# Introduction
Construction of aquifer and aquitard layers geometry was one of the most challenging aspects of this study. Simple interpolation of sparse point data (well picks) rarely produces layer surfaces that realistically represent the structure and continuity of complex hydrogeologic features such as channel and valley systems. To fully represent the complexity of the aquifers and aquitards in the Oak Ridges Moraine area, borehole lithology picks were supplemented with information obtained from, subtle hydrogeologic indicators (such as well screen placement and well depth) as well as from expert intuition and geologic conceptual understanding of the sedimentological processes. This information was integrated into the model construction process using 3-D polylines to constrain the interpolation processes.

Database integration, data flexible visualization, efficient layer picking tools, and geostatistical analysis functions provided by the VIEWLOG software made it possible to review and synthesize the large amounts of borehole data (discussed further below). The resulting hydrostratigraphic model not only honoured the borehole and well data, but also encapsulated the conceptual understanding of the processes that formed the Oak Ridges Moraine.
